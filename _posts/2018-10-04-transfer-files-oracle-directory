Sometimes you may need to copy files from or to the Oracle directory. It is easy when you have direct access to the database server's file system. It is a little bit tricky when you don't (AWS RDS instance for example).
One way to accomplish this is to create database link between the existing database (the one you have access to) and the target db and use DBMS_FILE_TRANSFER package to copy files between instances.
Here is another solution which doesn't need the second database. It is a powershell script which uses ODAC to access the database and then UTL_FILE package to read/write files on the database server.
It is influenced by this perl script from the stackoverflow.com. You may need to fix Oracle dll path on the "[Reflection.Assembly]::LoadFile" line.
