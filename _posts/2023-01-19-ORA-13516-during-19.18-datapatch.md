Hit the ORA-13516 error during datapatch during latest (19.18 JAN23) PSU installation.

datapatch throws this:
```
Patch 34765931 apply: WITH ERRORS
  logfile: /oracle/cfgtoollogs/sqlpatch/34765931/25078403/34765931_apply_SID_2023Jan18_14_20_33.log (errors)
  -> Error at line 9395: script rdbms/admin/backport_files/bug_33527739_apply.sql
      - ORA-13516: AWR Operation failed: CATPROC not valid
      - ORA-06512: at "SYS.DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY", line 328

      - ORA-06512: at line 12
```

Usually we patch the ORACLE_HOME, then start the DB in upgrade mode. After this we execute `datapatch -verbose` to patch DB dictionary, and finally restart DB in open mode. Not anymore. Since 19.12 (JUL21) both DB and OJVM patches don't require upgrade mode.

After restarting DB in open mode, the datapatch has sucseeded.

Looks like it makes sense to check PSU's readme from time to time ...
